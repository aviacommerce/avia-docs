## Overview

The `Configurations` in Aviacommerce is there to make configuration decisions and customize the store according to the admin. These general settings set up the store with initial basic info like storeâ€™s name, its metadata, the standard currency it uses, including mailer configuration details like sender mail and sendgrid API key to send emails on behalf of the store.

The important attributes of [`GeneralConfiguration`][1] model are:

- `name`: the title of the store.
- `meta description`: describes the store and how it's different from other e-commerce stores of it's kind.
- `meta keywords`: list of comma separated values to provide information about the store.
- `seo title`: a value to be assigned to the default SEO title field. SEO stands for "Search Engine Optimization" which is to enhance the store's visibility in the web search engine's results.
- `sender mail`: email id to be used for the store.
- `sendgrid api key`: sendgrid key to avail the email sending service provided by sendgrid.
- `currency`: the default currency for our store.

Modules for handling the business logic of the general configuration model :
- [`Snitch.Data.Schema.GeneralConfiguration`][1]: Defines the `general configuration` schema.
- [`Snitch.Data.Model.GeneralConfiguration`][2]: Handles the CRUD functions.
