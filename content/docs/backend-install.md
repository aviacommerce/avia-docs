Step-by-step guide to setup Avia Commerce locally for development and contribution.

## Pre-requisites

### Elixir
- Avia Commerce runs on Elixir 1.7+
  - [Install Elixir][1]
  - Check `elixir -v` to make sure it is 1.7 or higher.  
  - For version management we love [`asdf`][2] a lot.

### Hex 
- Installing Hex Package Manager
  - `mix local.hex`
  - To check the version `mix hex.info`

### Postgres
- At present Avia Commerce has been fully tested and exploited only on Postgres so
  make sure to have **postgres 9.5** or higher.
  - [Installation][3]
  - To check run `psql` and see the version in the prompt.

### Node
  - Installing [NodeJs][5]
  - The phoenix application in Avia Commerce uses [brunch.io][4] for asset management.
    Brunch uses _npm_ to install dependencies and npm requires node.js
  - Though phoenix suggests version node 5.0.0 or higher but to avoid any unwanted
    issues we would suggest **v 9.11.0** or higher.

### Wkhtmltopdf
  - [wkhtmltopdf][9] is a command line tool to render HTML into PDF. Used in generating 
  pdf invoices. Download [here][10].

### Elasticsearch
 - Installation [Elasticsearch][11]
 - **optional** Installation [Kibana][12]

## Repo
You can find all the repositories related to Avia Commerce [here][6]. 

We need to clone the `avia` repository on our local.  

To clone [this repo][13], follow the instructions given in the GitHub help on [Cloning a repository][14], and choose one of the following submodule-cloning techniques:

* Clone this repo and its submodule at the same, use the --recurse-submodules option:
  `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aviacommerce/avia.git`

* If you've already cloned this repo without its submodule, then run this command from the repo root:
  `git submodule update --init --remote`

```
IMPORTANT: Whenever you update your repo, update the submodule as well:
git pull; git submodule update --init --remote
```

## Setting up the Development Environment

### Setting up the system environment variables
  - Create a copy of the `env/example.env`
    ```
    > cp env/example.env env/local.env
    ```
  The env file has keys, secrets and paths required by application to run. After
  putting all the details for different keys, source it.
    ```
    > source env/local.env
    ```
  
  #### Image Upload Setup
  The default configuration to store uploaded images on development environment is
  local storage.

  #### Setting up for image upload on S3 \\TODO

### Configuring Postgres
  To setup the database we have to modify `/apps/snitch_core/config/dev.exs`.  
  The default setup for `dev` is.  
  ```
    config :snitch_core, Snitch.Repo,
      adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres,
      username: "postgres",
      password: "postgres",
      database: "snitch_dev",
      hostname: "localhost",
      pool_size: 10
  ```
 
  Replace the `username` and the `password` field with your local credentials for
  postgres. You can also change the `database` field to a name of your choice.

### Application Dependencies
From the root of the project run
```
> mix deps.get
```
This will install all the dependencies for the project.

### Setting Application Database
If you have already configured the database you can go ahead with steps mentioned
below, otherwise follow [Configuring Postgres][7].

- Move in to the snitch core directory
  ```
  > cd apps/snitch_core
  ```
- From the root of `snitch_core`
  - Create Database
    ```
    > mix ecto.create
    ```
  - Migrate the Database
    ```
    > mix ecto.migrate
    ```
  - Seed Database
    ```
    > mix run priv/repo/seed/seeds.exs
    ```
  - Create sample data
    ```
    > mix ecto.load.demo
    ```
### Setting Elasticsearch Indexing
 - keep elasticsearch running on port 9200 (if another port, then config that in local.env)
 - From root
    ```
    > mix cmd --app snitch_core mix elasticsearch.build products --cluster Snitch.Tools.ElasticsearchCluster
    ```

### Setting up Assets
The admin application in Avia Commerce is phoenix application with html.  
To setup the assets:
```
    > cd apps/addmin_app/assets
    > npm install
  ```

### Running the server

From the project root
```
> iex -S mix phx.server
```

This will run two servers one for the `admin application` and the `api application`
server.  

Browser Admin Interface
- http://localhost:4000

To run the `user interface` you will have to go through the [frontend installation][8].


in case you get `elm-make` command not found error on OS X from the project root:
```
yarn global add elm@0.18.0 && elm-package install -y
```
 and then type this:
```
cd apps/admin_app/assets && yarn install && cd elm && elm-package install --yes
```

this will install old version of elm compatibile with the project


### Running Tests
To run all the tests from your project root run the command
```
> mix test
```

You can also run the tests of individual applications from the root of those
applications. e.g. to run tests of core
```
> cd apps/snitch_core
> mix test
```
