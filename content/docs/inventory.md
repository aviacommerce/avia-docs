## Overview

Inventory management in Avia-commerce requires setting the inventory tracking on a product
so that we can track stock for the product.

Inventory management refers to the following things in Avia-commerce:
- maintain the stock level for product
- set low level for the stock to alert for updating the stock

Inventory for a product can be tracked in the following way:
- Don't track inventory
- Track inventory by product
- Track inventory by variant product

#### Don't track inventory

This inventory tracking does not track any stock for a product. Products with this
inventory tracking is always available for purchase.


#### Track inventory by product

This inventory tracking method tracks the stock for the product on which the
tracking is set. Even if the product has a variant product, the stock will always
be tracked for the parent product.

#### Track inventory by variant product

Using this inventory tracking we can track the stock for each variant product
separately
